      <h2>Introduction</h2>


      <p>Some of the earliest human remains in the fossil record are found in South Africa. Bantu speaking groups began settling into what is now northeastern South Africa displacing Khoisan speaking groups to the southwest. Dutchtraders landed at the southern tip of present-day South Africa in <time datetime="1652">1652</time>] and established a stopover point on the spice route between the Netherlands and the Far East, founding the city of Cape Town.</p>

      <p>After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in <time datetime="1806">1806</time>, many of the settlers of Dutch descent (Afrikaners, also called "Boers" (farmers) at the time) trekked north to found their own republics, Transvaal and Orange Free State. In the 1820s, several decades of wars began as the Zulus expanded their territory, moving out of what is today southeastern South Africa and clashing with other indigenous peoples and with expanding European settlements. The discovery of diamonds and gold spurred wealth and immigration from Europe.</p>

      <p>The Anglo-Zulu War resulted in the incorporation of the Zulu kingdom's territory into the British Empire. Subsequently, the Afrikaner republics were incorporated into the British Empire after their defeat in the Second South AfricanWar. However, the British and the Afrikaners ruled together beginning in <time datetime="1910">1910</time> under the Union of South Africa, which became a republic in <time datetime="1961">1961</time> after a whites-only referendum.</p>

      <p>In <time datetime="1948">1948</time>, the National Party was voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid â€“ billed as "separate development" of the races - which favored the white minority at the expense of the black majority and other non-white groups. The African National Congress <abbr title="African National Congress">(ANC)</abbr> led the opposition to apartheid and many top ANC leaders, such as Nelson MANDELA, spent decades in South Africa's prisons. Internal protests and insurgency, as well as boycotts by some Western nations and institutions, led to the regime's eventual willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to majority rule.</p>

      <p>The first multi-racial elections in <time datetime="1994">1994</time> following the end of apartheid ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government. South Africa has since struggled to address apartheid-era imbalances in wealth, housing, education, and health care. Jacob ZUMA became president in <time datetime="2009">2009</time> and was reelected in <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, but resigned in <time datetime="2018-02">Febeuary 2018</time> after numerous corruption scandals and gains by opposition parties in municipal elections in <time datetime="2016">2016</time>.</p>
