          <h3>Humane Society of New York Branding Project</h3>
          <p> This project was a complete re-branding of a non profit organization of our choice. I chose The Humane Society of New York because I love in New York City and love dogs, so I thought this would be a perfect fit. Everything in the
            project
            was created by me, from the logo, to the color pallete, to the mock ups, to the stationery. </p>

          <p> For this project, it was a personal branding project where I created my own logo, business cards, and letterhead. I really enjoyed this project because I got to create things that were personal to me and chose my own logo and color
            scheme. </p>

          <p> This project was to make a type specimen book for a font of our choice. I selected Futura, a sans-serif font, and used a Dolce&Gabana theme for my presentation because they use the futura type face for their logo. </p>
