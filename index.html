          I am involved in Chabad, AdGroup, and Sigma Delta Tau on campus. Additionally, I am a teachers assistant for my honors professor where I assist him and help the freshmen with their transition into school. On my site, I have inculded lots of
          my past work to showcase. I love to take pictures and capture important moments in my life whether it be candid with friends, scenery, or from traveling. I also have included lot of my past design work, I hope you enjoy it!
