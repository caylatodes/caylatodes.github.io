    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hi! I am Cayla Todes and I am from Manhattan, New York. I have lived on the Upper East Side my whole  life. I am a Sophomore at the University of Miami now. </p>

    <p>This is my first experience with code and so far I am really enjoying! Day by day, it is getting easier for me and I am remembering more and more. I am excited to see what I can do at the end of the semester! I can't wait to start adding color and design!</p>

    <h2>My Family</h2>
    <p> I have one younger brother, Josh, who is 16 years old. My dad, Mark, was and raised in South Africa. He immigrated to the US when he was 19 years old. My mom, Lisa, grew up in New Rochelle.</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p> For lower, middle, and high school, I attended Ramaz, a private Jewish school on the Upper East Side. There, I spent half of my day learning various different Hebrew subjects. As a result, I can speak Hebrew pretty fluently. At Ramaz, I was a member of the school dance team all four years and was the captain during my senior year. In additiom, I was in charge of designing, ordering, selling, and distributing all Ramaz branded apparel. Now, I am a Sophomore at the University of Miami where I am in the School of Communicaiton Honors program; I am majoring in media design and minoring in marketing and art. I love all things design.
